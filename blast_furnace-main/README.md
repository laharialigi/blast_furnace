# Blast Furnace Skin Temperature Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict blast furnace skin temperatures, providing sequential hourly forecasts. Itâ€™s implemented with a Flask web app for interactive temperature input and prediction.

## Project Structure

- **`app.py`**  
  The main Flask application file that loads the trained models and provides routes for user input and prediction.
  
- **`models.py`**  
  Includes code for data processing, model training, and evaluation, covering preprocessing steps like feature scaling and model selection (e.g., XGBoost).

- **`templates/`**  
  Contains HTML templates:
  - `index.html`: User input page for temperature values.
  - `result.html`: Displays the predicted temperatures and a line graph of predictions.

- **`static/`**  
  Stores CSS, JavaScript, and any images or generated graphs.

- **`models/`**  
  Holds serialized models (`model_1.pkl`, `model_2.pkl`, etc.) trained for multi-hour temperature predictions.
